Homework 2 - Create an FP[X] Game 


Note for Nick:

-There were issues with the character's rigidbody component, so please don't run into rocks even though they will knock over.  Only use the ray gun to clear paths.

-For the intended gameplay experience, always choose the left path first when you're in a cave.  

- There is no ending right now.
